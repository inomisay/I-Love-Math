# I Love Math
Write a C# program that takes the value of x (between 2 and 50), the value of y (between 25 and 30), and the type of the operator ∆ (* or +) from the user, and then finds the result of the following mathematical formula after 25 terms using nested loops.

This example formula shows the first 5 terms.
Don’t use Math functions like Math.Pow() and Math.Min().

**Notes:**
1. Your program must work correctly under all conditions. Try to control all possible errors.
2. You should use meaningful variable names, appropriate comments, and good prompting messages.
3. If you want, you may write your own “procedures / functions”. If you want, you may use an array data structure.
